# pet-clinic

This is a web application meant to manage a pet clinic. If you take a look at the code you will see that there are 2 modules. One for the back end and the data components of the project and also a module for the front end. This project uses technologies like the Spring Famework, Thymeleaf, JDBC, and J Unit. There are also a few test classes and integration tests. This is a full stack application and can be run by downloading these files into eclipse. During the development of this application you can see that I used Test-Driven Development in my amount of github contributions during the making of this project. 

Please feel free to leave me any suggestions!
